So looking at the data we can see that we have all hashes being completely unique to one another but some of the intermediary sha254
results are added which can only mean that the function call that created the intermediary results has some noise into it

Using brute force neural networks negates anypossibility of actually acquiring the function call]

Each of the result is made up of two floating decimal places: yet to find any relationship between that

Grouped the data into a duplicated dataset based on the column of the result since it was repeated and doing research ojn LSTM and MLP 
to see if they can find the relationship based on the two since prior research as already been carried out on the same
